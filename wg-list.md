# Working Groups

Community activity is organized into various Working Groups (WGs).

Each WG's material is in a sub-directory of this repository.

WGs generally follow these guidelines, although each of these groups may operate a little differently depending on their needs and workflow.

A new WG can be created, or old groups can be dissolved, as the needs of the Salt project change.
