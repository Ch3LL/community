# Communication

The SaltStack community has a [Code of Conduct]. All community members must abide by
this code.

## Working Groups

The SaltStack project is vast and is organized around areas of interest called "Working Groups".

For example, people interested in Salt's networking capability might join the "Networking" working
group. These groups meet often and are considered the primary maintainers of their respective areas
of the Salt project. For more information, please see the [Working Groups] page.

## Getting Help

**IRC Chat** - Join the vibrant, helpful and positive SaltStack chat room in
Freenode at #salt. There is no need to introduce yourself, or ask permission to
join in, just help and be helped! Make sure to wait for an answer, sometimes it
may take a few moments for someone to reply.
