## Issues Discussed

### PY2/PY3 Issues
When is Salt going to stop building Py2 versions?
- Neon will be the last release to support Py2

Minion connection issues (5 min) in Py3
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/54447
- Makes it difficult to transition to PY3 with these issues
- profiling/debugging the minion (yappi) to figure out why it takes 5 min

code page issues (cp437) in languages other than English
- Non latin characters cause errors
- a possible solution:
    - set codepage to 65001 in batch files, service startup, etc
    - remove code in `_run` that sets it to 437
    - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/cmdmod.py#L578

### MSI Issues

MSI build to be included in the Salt build scripts
- run the `build_env` script
- then run the `build` script

removing visual studio from msi to remove complexity
- There's a lot of code in the msi repo that allows you to build from Vuisual
  Studio. This adds to the complexity of the code and could be removed.
