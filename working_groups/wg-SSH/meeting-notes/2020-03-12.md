- Discussed the python2 deprecation work that will need to be done for Sodium:
  -> need to write new python version support SEP
  -> add ability for salt-ssh to copy over salt-bin binary to run salt-call with
     if python versions differ.
  -> add ability for someone to run a custom script before salt-ssh runs in order
     to install python3.
  -> add documentation and communicate across all channels
  (many of these steps are outlined in the original salt-ssh python3 SEP
   https://github.com/saltstack/salt-enhancement-proposals/pull/11)
