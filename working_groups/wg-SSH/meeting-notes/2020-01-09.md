## Meeting Details

Salt-Bin Update (pop-build)
  - The publish_port PR to ensure heist works has been merged into neon
     (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/55730) This will ensure we
     don't need to point to a personal repo in the requirements.txt file
     in salt-bin. Once neon is released we can remove this line
         `git+https://github.com/Ch3LL/salt.git@v2019.2.2-1`
     from the requirements.txt file in salt-bin repo.
  - There is a new project pop-build (https://github.com/saltstack/pop-build)
    The idea behind this project was to combine both pop-seed and salt-bin.
    Using this issue https://github.com/saltstack/pop-build/issues/1 to track
    the work to add salt-bin to pop-build

Review Issue: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49840
  - It was decided that we sould remove the line where it
    is resolving the dns as its not required and causes
    buggy behavior.

## Actions
  - add fix and test for https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49840
  - remove the personal repo pointer in salt-bin once neon is released
  - https://github.com/saltstack/pop-build/issues/1
